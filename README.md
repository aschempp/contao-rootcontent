# Root content extension for Contao Open Source CMS

The extension allows creating root-page aware content in Contao.


## Installation

Choose the installation method that matches your workflow!

### Installation via Contao Manager

Search for `terminal42/contao-pageimage` in the Contao Manager and add it
to your installation. Apply changes to update the packages.

### Manual installation

Add a composer dependency for this bundle. Therefore, change in the project root
and run the following:

```bash
composer require terminal42/contao-rootcontent
```

Depending on your environment, the command can differ, i.e. starting with
`php composer.phar â€¦` if you do not have composer installed globally.

Then, update the database via the `contao:migrate` command or the Contao install tool.


## Usage

There are multiple features to create root-page aware content.


### Create articles in the root page

The extension allows to create articles in the root page. Here's how it
works:

1. Edit your **theme** and add custom content sections. Each theme
   can have multiple sections with root content.
2. Add an article to a root page. Contrary to regular articles, you
   cannot enter a name but select one of the sections from your theme.
3. Create a root-content module in your theme and select the section
   you want to output.
4. Place the new module anywhere in your page layout.


### Limit front end modules per root page

For each front end module, there is a new setting to limit it for one
or multiple root pages. This way you can create language-aware modules.
Simply place all of them in your page layout and only the respective
ones will be rendered one at a time.


### `<body>` css class per root page

Add css classes to the root page and they will be inherited through all pages.
